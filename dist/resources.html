          <p>REVLIMID<sup>®</sup> (lenalidomide) in combination with dexamethasone (dex) is indicated for the treatment of
            adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM). REVLIMID is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with
            MM following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). REVLIMID is not indicated and is
            not recommended for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) outside of controlled
            clinical trials.</p>

          <h4><strong>WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY, HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, and VENOUS and ARTERIAL
              THROMBOEMBOLISM</strong></h4>
          <p><u>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</u><br>
            Do not use REVLIMID during pregnancy. Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a
            developmental monkey study. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-threatening human
            birth defects. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo-fetal death. In
            females of reproductive potential, obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting REVLIMID treatment.
            Females of reproductive potential must use 2 forms of contraception or continuously abstain from heterosexual
            sex during and for 4 weeks after REVLIMID treatment. To avoid embryo-fetal exposure to lenalidomide, REVLIMID
            is only available through a restricted distribution program, the REVLIMID REMS<sup>®</sup> program.</p>
          <p>Information about the REVLIMID REMS program is available at <a class="js-external-link"
              href="http://www.celgeneriskmanagement.com" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">www.celgeneriskmanagement.com</a>&nbsp;or by calling the manufacturer’s toll-free number
            1-888-423-5436.</p>
          <p><u>Hematologic Toxicity (Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia)</u><br>
            REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Eighty percent of patients with del 5q MDS
            had to have a dose delay/reduction during the major study. Thirty-four percent of patients had to have a
            second dose delay/reduction. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the
            study. Patients on therapy for del 5q MDS should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the
            first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or
            reduction. Patients may require use of blood product support and/or growth factors.</p>
          <p><u>Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism</u><br>
            REVLIMID has demonstrated a significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
            (PE), as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with MM who were treated with REVLIMID
            and dexamethasone therapy. Monitor for and advise patients about signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise
            patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or
            arm or leg swelling. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the choice of regimen should be based on an
            assessment of the patient’s underlying risks.</p>

        <div class="tray__block tray__block--copy tray__block--no-border">
          <h4><span class="celgene-light-blue">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></h4>
          <p><b>Pregnancy:</b> REVLIMID can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated
            in females who are pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while
            taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions:</b> REVLIMID is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated
            severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to
            lenalidomide.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span class="dara-green"><strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR DARATUMUMAB</strong></span></p>
          <p>Daratumumab is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic
            reactions) to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation.</p>

            <li style="color: #00b5e2;"><span style="color: #000;"><u>Males</u>: Lenalidomide is present in the semen of
                patients receiving the drug. Males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact
                with females of reproductive potential while taking REVLIMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing
                REVLIMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking REVLIMID must not
                donate sperm.</span></li>
            <li style="color: #00b5e2;"><span style="color: #000;"><u>Blood Donation</u>: Patients must not donate blood
                during treatment with REVLIMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood
                might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to REVLIMID.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>REVLIMID REMS<sup>®</sup> Program</strong>: <strong>See Boxed WARNINGS</strong>: Prescribers and
            pharmacies must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS<sup>®</sup> program by enrolling and complying with the
            REMS requirements; pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive REVLIMID. Patients
            must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with REMS requirements; female patients of
            reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception
            requirements and males must comply with contraception requirements.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Hematologic Toxicity:</b>&nbsp;REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor
            patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising,
            especially with use of concomitant medications that may increase risk of bleeding.&nbsp;Patients may require a
            dose interruption and/or dose reduction. <strong><u>MM</u>: </strong>Monitor complete blood counts in patients
            taking REVLIMID + dexamethasone or REVLIMID as maintenance therapy, every 7 days for the first 2 cycles, on
            days 1 and 15 of cycle 3, and every 28 days thereafter.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism:</b><strong> See Boxed WARNINGS:&nbsp;</strong>Venous thromboembolic
            events (DVT and PE) and arterial thromboses (MI and CVA) are increased in patients treated with REVLIMID.
            Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk and actions should be
            taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking).
            Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the regimen should be based on the patient’s underlying risks.
            Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their
            use should be based on a benefit-risk decision.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Increased Mortality in Patients With CLL:</b> In a clinical trial in the first-line treatment of patients
            with CLL, single-agent REVLIMID therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single-agent chlorambucil.
            Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac
            failure, occurred more frequently in the REVLIMID arm. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use
            in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Second Primary Malignancies (SPM): </b>In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving REVLIMID and in
            patients with FL or MZL receiving REVLIMID + rituximab therapy, an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor
            SPM, notably AML, have been observed. In patients with MM, MDS was also observed. Monitor patients for the
            development of SPM. Take into account both the potential benefit of REVLIMID and risk of SPM when considering
            treatment.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Increased Mortality With Pembrolizumab:</b> In clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of
            pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of
            patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus
            dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Hepatotoxicity:</b> Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with REVLIMID
            + dexamethasone. Pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant
            medications may be risk factors. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop REVLIMID upon elevation of liver
            enzymes. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Severe Cutaneous Reactions:</strong> Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome
            (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
            have been reported. These events can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with
            thalidomide treatment should not receive REVLIMID. Consider REVLIMID interruption or discontinuation for Grade
            2-3 skin rash. Permanently discontinue REVLIMID for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other
            severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN, or DRESS.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):</strong> Fatal instances of TLS have been reported during treatment with
            REVLIMID. The patients at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Closely monitor
            patients at risk and take appropriate preventive approaches.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Tumor Flare Reaction (TFR):</strong> TFR has occurred during investigational use of REVLIMID for CLL
            and lymphoma. Monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended in patients with MCL, FL, or MZL. Tumor flare
            may mimic the progression of disease (PD). In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, it is recommended to withhold
            treatment with REVLIMID until TFR resolves to ≤Grade 1. REVLIMID may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and
            2 TFR without interruption or modification, at the physician’s discretion.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization:</strong> A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after
            treatment (&gt;4 cycles) with REVLIMID has been reported. Consider early referral to transplant center to
            optimize timing of the stem cell collection.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Thyroid Disorders:</strong> Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported. Measure
            thyroid function before starting REVLIMID treatment and during therapy.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Early Mortality in Patients With MCL:</strong> In another MCL study, there was an increase in early
            deaths (within 20 weeks); 12.9% in the REVLIMID arm versus 7.1% in the control arm. Risk factors for early
            deaths include high tumor burden, MIPI score at diagnosis, and high WBC at baseline (≥10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L).
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Hypersensitivity: </strong>Hypersensitivity including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic

          <ul>
            <li style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Infusion reactions: </strong>Interrupt daratumumab infusion for infusion
              reactions of any severity. Permanently discontinue the infusion in case of anaphylactic reactions or
              life-threatening infusion reactions and institute appropriate emergency care.</li>
            <li><strong>Interference with cross-matching and red blood cell antibody screening:</strong> Type and screen
              patients prior to starting treatment. Inform blood banks that a patient has received daratumumab.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutropenia:</strong> Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment. Monitor
              patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery of
              neutrophils.</li>
            <li><strong>Thrombocytopenia: </strong>Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment. Dose
              delay may be required to allow recovery of platelets.</li>
            <li><strong>Interference With Determination of Complete Response:</strong> Daratumumab can interfere with the
              determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma
              protein.</li>

                obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.
                There is a REVLIMID pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to
                REVLIMID during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to REVLIMID. This
                registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure
                to REVLIMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to Celgene Corporation, a
                Bristol Myers Squibb company, at 1-888-423-5436.</span></li>

                REVLIMID on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential
                for adverse reactions in breastfed infants from REVLIMID, advise female patients not to breastfeed during
                treatment with REVLIMID.</span></li>
