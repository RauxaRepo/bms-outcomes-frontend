          REVLIMID<sup>®</sup> (lenalidomide) is a prescription medicine, used to treat adults with multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with the medicine dexamethasone, or as maintenance treatment after autologous hematopoietic stem cell
          transplantation (a type of stem cell transplant that uses your own stem cells).REVLIMID should not be used to treat people who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) unless they are participants in a controlled clinical trial. It is not
          known if REVLIMID is safe and effective in children.</p>

        <h4 class="celgene-light-blue">What is the most important information I should know about REVLIMID?</h4>
        <p>
          Before you begin taking REVLIMID, you must read and agree to all of the instructions in the REVLIMID<br>
          REMS<sup>®</sup> program. Before prescribing REVLIMID, your healthcare provider will explain the REVLIMID
          REMS<br>
          program to you and have you sign the Patient-Physician Agreement Form
        </p>

        <p>REVLIMID may cause serious side effects, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li style="padding-top: 0;">
            <strong>Possible birth defects (deformed babies) or death of an unborn baby.</strong> Females who are<br class="break-desktop">
            pregnant or who plan to become pregnant must not take REVLIMID.
            <br>
            <div style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>REVLIMID is similar to the medicine thalidomide</strong> which is known to cause severe
            life-threatening<br class="break-desktop"> birth defects. REVLIMID has not been tested in pregnant females. REVLIMID has harmed<br class="break-desktop">
            unborn animals in animal testing.

            <strong>Females who can become pregnant:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li style="padding-top: 0;">Must have pregnancy tests weekly for 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks if your menstrual cycle is<br class="break-desktop"> regular, or every 2 weeks if your menstrual cycle is irregular. </li>
              <li>If you miss your period or have unusual bleeding, you will need to have a pregnancy test and<br class="break-desktop"> receive counseling.</li>
              <li>Must agree to use 2 different forms of effective birth control at the same time, for at least 4<br class="break-desktop"> weeks before, while taking, during any breaks (interruptions) in your treatment, and for at<br
                  class="break-desktop"> least 4 weeks after stopping REVLIMID.</li>
              <li>Talk with your healthcare provider to find out about options for effective forms of birth control<br class="break-desktop"> that you may use to prevent pregnancy before, during, and after treatment with REVLIMID.</li>
              <li>If you had unprotected sex or if you think your birth control has failed, stop taking REVLIMID<br class="break-desktop"> immediately and call your healthcare provider right away.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>If you become pregnant while taking REVLIMID, stop taking it right away and call your<br class="break-desktop"> healthcare provider.</strong> If your healthcare provider is not available, you can call Celgene Customer<br
              class="break-desktop"> Care Center at 1-888-423-5436. Healthcare providers and patients should report all cases of<br class="break-desktop"> pregnancy to:
            <ul style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
              <li>FDA MedWatch at 1-800-FDA-1088, and </li>
              <li>Celgene Corporation at 1-888-423-5436.</li>
            </ul>
            There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors the outcomes of females who take REVLIMID<br class="break-desktop"> during pregnancy, or if their male partner takes REVLIMID and they are exposed during pregnancy.<br
              class="break-desktop"> You can enroll in this registry by calling Celgene Corporation at the phone number listed above.
            <br><br>
            <strong>REVLIMID can pass into human semen:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Males, including those who have had a vasectomy, must always use a latex or synthetic<br class="break-desktop"> condom during any sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female that can become<br class="break-desktop"> pregnant while taking REVLIMID, during any breaks
                (interruptions) in your treatment with<br class="break-desktop"> REVLIMID, and for up to 4 weeks after stopping REVLIMID.</li>
              <li>Do not have unprotected sexual contact with a female who is or could become pregnant. Tell<br class="break-desktop"> your healthcare provider if you do have unprotected sexual contact with a female who is or<br class="break-desktop"> could become pregnant.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom: 0;">Do not donate sperm while taking REVLIMID, during any breaks (interruptions) in your<br class="break-desktop"> treatment, and for 4 weeks after stopping REVLIMID. If a female becomes pregnant with your<br class="break-desktop"> sperm, the baby may be exposed to REVLIMID and may be
                born with birth defects.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Men: If a female becomes pregnant with your sperm, you should call your HCP right away.</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Low white blood cells (neutropenia) and low platelets (thrombocytopenia).</strong> REVLIMID causes<br class="break-desktop"> low white blood cells and low platelets in most people. You may need a blood transfusion or certain<br
              class="break-desktop"> medicines if your blood counts drop too low. Your healthcare provider should check your blood counts<br class="break-desktop"> often, especially during the first several months of treatment with REVLIMID, and then
            at least<br class="break-desktop"> monthly. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any bleeding or bruising during treatment with<br class="break-desktop"> REVLIMID.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blood clots.</strong> Blood clots in the arteries, veins, and lungs happen more often in people who take<br class="break-desktop"> REVLIMID. This risk is even higher for people with multiple myeloma who take the medicine<br
              class="break-desktop"> dexamethasone with REVLIMID. Heart attacks and strokes also happen more often in people who<br class="break-desktop"> take REVLIMID with dexamethasone. To reduce this increased risk, most people who take
            REVLIMID<br class="break-desktop"> will also take a blood thinner medicine.<br><br>
            Before taking REVLIMID, tell your healthcare provider:
            <ul>
              <li>if you have had a blood clot in the past;</li>
              <li>if you have high blood pressure, smoke, or if you have been told you have a high level of fat<br class="break-desktop"> in your blood (hyperlipidemia); and</li>
              <li>about all the medicines you take. Certain other medicines can also increase your risk for<br class="break-desktop"> blood clots</li>
            </ul>
            Call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you get any of the following during<br class="break-desktop"> treatment with REVLIMID:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li style="padding-top: 0;"><strong>Signs or symptoms of a blood clot in the lung, arm, or leg may include:</strong> shortness of<br class="break-desktop"> breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling</li>
